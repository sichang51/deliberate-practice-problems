# 2 Convert an array of hashes into a hash using the :id key from the array's hashes as the keys in the new hash.
#   For example, [{id: 1, color: "blue", price: 32}, {id: 2, color: "red", price: 12}]

#   For example, {321 => {name: "Alice", age: 31}, 322 => {name: "Maria", age: 27}} 
#   becomes [{id: 321, name: "Alice", age: 31}, {id: 322, name: "Maria", age: 27}].

# 6 Convert an array of strings into a hash with keys for each string in the array and values for the number of times the string appears in the array.
#   For example, ["do", "or", "do", "not"] becomes {"do" => 2, "or" => 1, "not" => 1}.

# 7 Convert a hash into a flat array containing all the hashâ€™s keys and values.
#   For example, {"a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c" => 3, "d" => 4} becomes ["a", 1, "b", 2, "c", 3, "d", 4].

#   For example, {"chair" => 75, "book" => 15} and [{name: "chair", color: "red", weight: 10}, {name: "book", color: "black", weight: 1}] 
#   becomes {"chair" => {price: 75, color: "red", weight: 10}, "book" => {price: 15, color: "black", weight: 1}}.

    index1 += 1

# 9 Convert an array of hashes into a hash of arrays, using the author as keys and the titles as values.
#   For example, [{author: "Jeff Smith", title: "Bone"}, {author: "George Orwell", title: "1984"}, {author: "Jeff Smith", title: "RASL"}] 
#   becomes {"Jeff Smith" => ["Bone", "RASL"], "George Orwell" => ["1984"]}.

# 10 Given a hash, create a new hash that has the keys and values switched.
#   For example, {"a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c" => 3} becomes {1 => "a", 2 => "b", 3 => "c"}.
